## 👩‍💻 About Me
I enjoy solving public policy problems using data-driven approaches and creating impactful visualizations to tell meaningful stories. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in **data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools**.

## 🔗 Past Projects
### **Streamlit Machine Learning Projects (Supervised & Unsupervised)**
   - **Project Overview**: A diverse collection of machine learning projects exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and built streamlit websites with interactive capabilities for users to explore these ML techniques. (Present on GitHub repositories!)
   - **Key Achievements**:
     - Built predictive models using supervised techniques (e.g., regression, classification).
     - Explored unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., clustering, PCA) to uncover hidden patterns in data.
     - Developed end-to-end machine learning pipelines, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - **Repository**: [Streamlit Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/klangford0924/LANGFORD-Data-Science-Portfolio-/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

       
### **Rural vs. Urban Crime Analysis: A Wisconsin Case Study**
   - **Project Overview**: Conducted a detailed analysis of crime patterns across rural and urban areas in Wisconsin using data from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
   - **Key Achievements**: 
     - Developed interactive visualizations to compare crime rates across regions.
     - Identified key trends in crime distribution, enabling data-driven policy recommendations for law enforcement agencies.

### **Data-Driven Governance: A Strategic Roadmap for the City of Denver**
   - **Project Overview**: Presented a comprehensive data-driven governance strategy to the City of Denver, focusing on utilizing analytics for improved public administration and resource management.
   - **Key Achievements**:
     - Delivered actionable insights and strategies to optimize city services and infrastructure based on data analysis.
     - Collaborated with local government officials to highlight key areas for implementing machine learning and data analytics.


## 🛠️ Skills
- **Machine Learning Techniques** Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Regression (Multilinear, Logistic)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau
- **Other Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Google Sheets, Streamlit

## 🎓 Education 
- English and American Studies major with minors in Data Science and Public Service at the University of Notre Dame
